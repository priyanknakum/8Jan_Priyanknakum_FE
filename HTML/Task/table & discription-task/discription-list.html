        design engineering stands as a transformative discipline challenging
        traditional engineering norms. The conventional emphasis on crafting
        "better things" has evolved, now necessitating a commitment to "making
        things better" amidst the pressing issues of climate change,
        sustainability, and socially just transitions to a net-zero future.

        The main objective of the Contributor Personality Development Program is
        to equip students with not only right skills but also the right
        mindsets. The Combination of effectiveness with human values is
        crystallized in the concept of “contributor ship”.

        CAD is the use of computers in the design process of objects, structures
        and buildings. It is used to create accurate 2D drawings and 3D models.
        CAD improves designers’ productivity, quality and communication. It also
        allows for easy modification, documentation and collaboration of
        designs. CAD is used across a wide range of industries, such as
        architecture, engineering, construction, product design, graphic design
        and manufacturing. CAD is used for design, while CAM is used for
        manufacturing. They work together to provide more control over the
        entire process from conceptualization to realization.

      <dt><strong>Applied Thermodynamics</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        Thermodynamics in physics is a branch that deals with heat, work and
        temperature, and their relation to energy, radiation and physical
        properties of matter. To be specific, it explains how thermal energy is
        converted to or from other forms of energy and how matter is affected by
        this process. Thermal energy is the energy that comes from heat. This
        heat is generated by the movement of tiny particles within an object,
        and the faster these particles move, the more heat is generated.

      <dd>
        Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) is the use of software and
        computer-controlled machinery to automate a manufacturing
        process.Without CAM, there is no CAD. CAD focuses on the design of a
        product or part. How it looks, how it functions. CAM focuses on how to
        make it. You can design the most elegant part in your CAD tool, but if
        you can’t efficiently make it with a CAM system, then you’re better off
        kicking rocks.

      <dt><strong>Advance Manufacturing Processes</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        Advanced manufacturing is the use of innovative technology to improve
        products or processes with the relevant technology being described as
        advanced, innovative or cutting edge. Advanced manufacturing industries
        increasingly integrate new innovative technologies in both products and
        processes. The rate of technology adoption and the ability to use that
        technology to remain competitive and add value to define the advanced
        manufacturing sector.[1]

      <dd>
        Industry 4.0 is revolutionizing the way companies manufacture, improve
        and distribute their products. Manufacturers are integrating new
        technologies, including Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing and
        analytics, and AI and machine learning into their production facilities
        and throughout their operations.
